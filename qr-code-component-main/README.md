## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
<!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->


### What I learned
1.
```css
.attribution a:hover{
    transition: 300ms;
    opacity: .6;
    padding: 1rem;
}
/* you can make a smooth rubber effect like this */
```
2. learned how to  write md docs.


### Continued development
Will try to learn more about css grid and flexbox.
